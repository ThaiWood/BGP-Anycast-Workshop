# BGP-Anycast-Workshop

This repo contains everything you need to setup a BGP Anycast Workshop and the instructions to walk through the lab. Attendees will learn how to automate the deployment of a multi host, BGP IPv6 Anycast enabled network using tools such as Terraform and BIRD. Students will need a SSH client (such as PuTTY) to use this lab. Some experience with the Linux command line is required.
